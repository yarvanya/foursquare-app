## Foursqure API App
Front End

This is the Front End part of project "foursquare-app".
This service will help people to find their venues in favorite cities.

# About Foursquare API globally:

Foursquare is primarily for letting your friends know where you are and figuring out where they are.
Secondarily, it's for collecting points, prize "badges," and eventually, coupons, for going about your everyday business.

And it's becoming popular. Foursquare now has almost 275,000 users in less than a year.

### To start it on your computer you should have node v6.9.4 or upper
### installed globally.

#### Next follow this commands:

  - git clone https://github.com/yarvanya/foursquare-app.git

  - cd foursquare-app

  - npm install

  - npm run start

Back end part of project maybe will be implemented in the future. :)
